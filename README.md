# Mongodb

NoSQl(Mongodb):
1)NoSQL databases were created in response to the limitations of traditional relational database technology.
2)When compared against relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior
performance, and their data model addresses several shortcomings of the relational model.

The advantages of NoSQL include being able to handle:
• Large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
• Agile sprints, quick iteration, and frequent code pushes
• Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
• Efficient, scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture

When to use NoSQL Database?
• When you want to store and retrieve huge amount of data.
• The relationship between the data you store is not that important
• The data is not structured and changing over time
• Constraints and Joins support is not required at database level
• The data is growing continuously and you need to scale the database regular to handle the data.

Where to use NoSQL Database?
• Data isn't relational (e.g. Documents)
• Too much data to fit in a relational database
